## Why ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If you don't use a DAM and instead categorize lots of "stuff" into folders and then sub-folders, it can become difficult to know what you have. Databases and notes apps like Evernote or Bear or Apple Notes are nice because they can be programmed to just show you how much stuff you have all the time and how many items you in each category but file-system storage systems don't quickly have this reporting. This allows you to quickly get this report. 

## How üìã
1. Rename config-sample.py to config.py (which is ignored by git)
2. Add the path to the folder you wish to scan in the config and the location for the text file that will contain your summary info
3. Run the script however you wish. Via terminal just `Python3 /path/to/scan-alphaoutput.py` ` should work.
